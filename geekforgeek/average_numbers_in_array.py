Given an unsorted array arr[], the task is to find the mean of the array.

Note: Return the floor value of the mean.

Examples : 

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 4, 2, 6, 5, 8, 7]
Output: 4
Explanation: Sum of the elements is 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 7 = 36, 
Mean = 36/8 = 4.5. 
Floor(4.5) = 4.

Input: arr[] = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
Output: 4
Explanation: Sum of the elements is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20, 
Mean = 20/5 = 4
